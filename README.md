# Ella
Ella is a platform that empowers women and girls by providing mentorship, career guidance, and access to valuable educational resources. It features an AI chatbot that delivers personalized roadmaps, advice, and support to help users achieve their career and educational goals.

## Inspiration
A recent UN report states that while the amount of women and girls having access to education is increasing, 39% of young women fail to complete upper-secondary school. In the digital age, we have more access to a wide array of educational resources and tools than ever before. However, for these tools to work effectively, there needs to be an intermediary to funnel important information and provide a neat, effective roadmap for women and girls to access high-quality, affordable education with just an internet connection.

This is where **Ella** comes in! Bridging the gap between resources and results, Ella answers questions and supports women and girls who are looking to expand their education and progress in their careers.
